# Hi! I'm Valentin Cristian Ghita, aka CoderArtist06

I'm an IT Technician graduate from a technical institute in computer science, and I’m currently studying Computer and Electronic Engineering at the University of Ferrara.

I enjoy programming in C and Python, and I also have experience with other languages and technologies. My main interests are CyberSecurity, Artificial Intelligence, and more recently game development as a personal hobby.

## 🌍 Languages
- **Italian** (native)
